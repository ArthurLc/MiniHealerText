FAQ_0_TITLE=Why am I getting instantly killed?
FAQ_0_DESC=Most of the time it is because there may be some mechanics that you are missing, reading the skills and environmental effects of the boss would be a start. Other times it could mean that you might need to upgrade your defensive stats, gaining more resistances is a huge help towards survivability
FAQ_1_TITLE=I read the mechanics but I still feel stuck, do I need to grind for levels?
FAQ_1_DESC=In the early stage of the game (roughly level 30), gaining a few more level will help significantly. However at later stages (roughly level 50), levels become more and more insignificant. There are more ways to improve your party other than grinding levels such as crafting, gaining other trees' passive mastery level stats, upgrading gears...etc
FAQ_2_TITLE=Bosses are dying so slow, what should I do?
FAQ_2_DESC=Try making a balance of your damage and healing. You should always try to survive first, then you can think about turning excessive defense/healing into damage. You can also checkout the Builds section for a general idea on how to do that
FAQ_3_TITLE=What are some ways to improve my party at the later game?
FAQ_3_DESC=Crafting plays a big role in Mini Healer, make sure your items are fully augmented/upgraded/mutated is a great start. Trying out different builds in other trees will also help as gaining Mastery Level will passively increase the stats even if you have no points invested in that class. Utilizing Dice of Greed is a good way to also quickly fill in a slot that's long due for upgrade
FAQ_4_TITLE=What is the maximum level? Do I need to reach the maximum level to beat the game?
FAQ_4_DESC=The maximum level is 100 and you absolutely do not need to be even close to the maximum level to beat the game, most people beat the current state of the game at around level 85-90
FAQ_5_TITLE=Ok, but how do I get more levels more efficiently?
FAQ_5_DESC=Chaotic bosses will have their exp/gold reward increased significantly. Clearing bosses that have already been chaotic by the game is also a good way to gain more Chaos Crystals
FAQ_6_TITLE=Are the Unique(Orange) items always the best?
FAQ_6_DESC=Absolutely not, most of the them provide less stats than other Epic or Rare items but have unique effects that you may want for your build. So keep an eye on those purple and blue items, they might have significantly higher stats than your unique items.
FAQ_7_TITLE=How do I find a certain item?
FAQ_7_DESC=You can use the atlas to find not only a specific item, but all items that have a certain attribute as well. For example, you can search the atlas for "Aura" to display all items that have something to do with auras. Then you can check where the item drops and use the quick travel to immediately travel to that zone.
FAQ_8_TITLE=I don't see a point of Uncommon (Green) items
FAQ_8_DESC=All rarity of items in Mini Healer has their purpose. Uncommon (Green) items have the least amount of attributes, but they are the only items that can have Rune Socket, meaning they are the only items that can be turned into Runeword items. Rare (Blue) items have increased amount of attributes, but they are the only items that can roll +2 to a single talent as well as +EXP/Gold/Drop Rate chance attributes. Epic (Purple) items have the most amount of attributes, but they do not roll or provide anything special.
FAQ_9_TITLE=What is item level?
FAQ_9_DESC=Item level is just a rough indicator on how strong the item is compared to another.
FAQ_10_TITLE=What exactly is quality?
FAQ_10_DESC=Most attributes have a range of stats, quality will determine what stat the item get. For example, if a sword has 10-100 damage, a quality 5 sword will have 50 damage. You can find the range of stats on each unique items in the Atlas.
FAQ_11_TITLE=What is the shining cloud on my item?
FAQ_11_DESC=The shining cloud means the item has a base quality of 10 or above
FAQ_12_TITLE=What is the star beside my augmentations
FAQ_12_DESC=The star just means that the augmentation rolled maximum quality of its tier
FAQ_13_TITLE=Can mutation roll 2 positive mutations?
FAQ_13_DESC=No, mutation will always roll 1 positive and 1 negative mutations
FAQ_14_TITLE=What are runes?
FAQ_14_DESC=Runes can be socketed into a Rune Socket that show up on an Uncommon(Green) item. Socketing runes in a specific order will turn the Uncommon(Green) item into a Runeword item, making it gain additional power
FAQ_15_TITLE=How do I know the combination of a runeword?
FAQ_15_DESC=Trail and error is your first best friend. However, in the Rune Atlas you can have the option of purchasing a hint that will help towards solving the word
FAQ_16_TITLE=Understanding Damage/Healing Scaling
FAQ_16_DESC=Most damage/healing in Mini Healer scales off from something. For example, Druid's talent Rapid Shot states that "... deal x% of Ranger's total damage". This means that the more damage the Ranger has, the more damage Rapid Shot will do.
FAQ_17_TITLE=Understanding Damage Source
FAQ_17_DESC=Most damage in Mini Healer comes from something. For example, Druid's talent Rapid Shot states that "Ranger deals....". This means that the damage is coming from Ranger, so getting attributes like "% Ranger/Party damage" will also increase the damage of Rapid Shot
FAQ_18_TITLE=Understanding Damage Element
FAQ_18_DESC=Every damage in Mini Healer belongs to a damage type. For example, Druid's talent Rapid Shot states that "...as Physical damage". This means that the damage is Physical, so getting attributes like "% Ranger/Party Physical damage" will also increase the damage of Rapid Shot
FAQ_19_TITLE=Understanding Talents
FAQ_19_DESC=Majority of the time, the deeper the talent node, the better it is. In most cases you can try to reach the bottom of the skill trees sooner by spending the least amount of points required to go down
FAQ_20_TITLE=There are so many choices, what are some of the good builds?
FAQ_20_DESC=It is more fun to come up with your own build, but if you are looking for inspiration you can always join the discord and check out the #build channel for inspiration
